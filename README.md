# Mutation Test

Uses [Pitest/PIT](https://pitest.org/).

Note: Reports may be hard to read because PIT does not modify your source code:
> PIT applies a configurable set of mutation operators (or mutators) to the byte code generated by compiling your code.
- https://pitest.org/quickstart/basic_concepts/
> Note that PIT is a bytecode mutator - it does not compile your code but instead modifies the byte code in memory.
> Pitest mutates bytecode, does that mean it works with all JVM languages?
- https://pitest.org/faq/

To see our bytecode and know what might be going on...:
```bash
javap -c -l target/classes/ch/paulfrischknecht/Palindrome.class
```

> Although the Java virtual machine defines a boolean type, it only provides very limited support for it. There are no Java virtual machine instructions solely dedicated to operations on boolean values. Instead, expressions in the Java programming language that operate on boolean values are compiled to use values of the Java virtual machine int data type.
> The Java virtual machine encodes boolean array components using 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false.

> What does this "Substituted 2 with 3" mean exactly, i.e. what are the 2 and 3?
> The constants here are in the code the compiler generates to handle the array used to implement the varargs parameter to String.format. The 2 will be the size of the array created to hold the 2 objects passed as varargs.
> This is not intentional behaviour - just a consequence of mutating bytecode rather than source.

# Initial Setup
```echo
mkdir -p src/main/java
mkdir -p src/test/java

echo 'package ch.paulfrischknecht;

public class Main {
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}' > src/main/java/Main.java

mvn install
```


# Solution
```java
if (inputString.length() <= 1)
    
tests:


        assertTrue(palindrome.isPalindrome("aa"));
        assertFalse(palindrome.isPalindrome("ab"));
        assertFalse(palindrome.isPalindrome("ba")); // !!
        assertTrue(palindrome.isPalindrome("a"));
        assertTrue(palindrome.isPalindrome("aba"));
        assertFalse(palindrome.isPalindrome("xabx")); // !!
```
